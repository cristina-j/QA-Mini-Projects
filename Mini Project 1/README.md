# Login Validation Scripts  

This folder contains two versions of my **login validation** scripts in Python.  

---

## What’s in here  
- **`login_validation.py`**: my first version is a step-by-step script that checks if a username and password are valid. It uses `input()` to let me test credentials interactively.  
- **`login_validation_function.py`**: a refactored version where the login logic is written as a **function** that returns `True` or `False`. This shows how the same code can be reused and tested with multiple inputs.

## Why I created these  
I’m learning Python as part of my transition from **Manual QA → QA Engineer**. What I have learned next is what a function is and how to define it. This project helped me practice:  
- Writing if/else logic to check valid vs invalid login attempts  
- Thinking in terms of positive and negative test cases  
- Understanding how to refactor code into functions for reusability

## What I learned about functions  
A **function in Python** is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.  
- You define a function once with `def function_name():`  
- You can then **call** it many times with different inputs.  
- Functions make your code **cleaner, reusable, and easier to test**.

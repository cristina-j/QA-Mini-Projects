# Password Validator Scripts  

This folder contains two versions of my **Password Validator** project in Python.  

---

## Whatâ€™s in here  
- **`validate_password.py`**: my first version which is a step-by-step script that checks if a password meets certain requirements. It asks for input and gives the user up to 3 attempts before locking them out.  
- **`validate_password_function.py`**: a refactored version where the password checks are written as a **function** that returns `True` or `False`. This allows me to test multiple passwords quickly with print statements.  

---

## Why I created these  
I wanted to practice writing a password policy checker similar to what real systems use. This project helped me practice:  
- Using variables, loops, and if/else statements to enforce rules  
- Handling different negative cases (too short, no number, no special character)  
- Refactoring into a function to make the code reusable and easier to test
